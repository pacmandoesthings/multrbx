	['Trello'] = false; --Pulls Bans/Admins from a Trello board every set number of seconds on every server of everygame this script is in (that has Http enabled and uses the same BoardID)
	
	['BoardID'] = '9HH6BEX2'; --Trello board ID, its in the URL of your board: https://trello.com/b/9HH6BEX2/epix-incorporated-synced-ban-list - The id for this board is 9HH6BEX2 (by default uses our exploiter ban list.)
	
	['HttpWait'] = 10; --How often (in seconds) should the list(s) update? Recommended 10+ to avoid HttpService problems
	
		--[[
		You NEED to enable HttpEnabled in order for this to work! To enable it follow the below instructions:
		Run this following command in the command bar as shown in the screenshot: game:service('HttpService').HttpEnabled=true print('Enabled Http')
		Screen shot: http://prntscr.com/46uztz
		
		How to set up your own multi-game list for your games:
		
		Below instructions are for bans but can also be applied to admin lists,
		refer to "To use this for synced admin lists" under the instructions for admin lists info. 
		
		By default the Trello settings are set to use our ban list of exploiters, but you may 
		want to change it so that you can set up and control your own multi-game, autoupdating 
		list(s). So now I am going to tell you how to do that.
		
		1. Enable Http, refer to a few lines up to learn how to easily and quickly do that.
		2. Make a Trello account (or sign in with google)
			-Go to http://trello.com, click "Log in with Google" or "Sign up-It's Free" and do the account making stuff it tells you to
		3. After you sign up/log in you need to make a new board, click the + then click "New Board..." - http://prntscr.com/46v2fq
		4. Give your board a name and click the "Change..." next to "This board will be private" and make sure you make the board public! - http://prntscr.com/46v4bf
		5. Change one of the lists titles to "Ban List" In the screenshot I accidentally typed "cards" instead of "lists" - http://prntscr.com/46v5af
		6. Add people to the bans by clicking "Add a card..." and then typing their username as the title, username:userid, or if its a group Group: groupname:groupid - http://prntscr.com/46v74e
		7. Now you need to just set BoardID to your board's ID, refer to http://prntscr.com/46v74e for this, or refer to the comment next to the BoardID setting
		8. You are done, just configure the BoardID and enable Http in each of your games and your multigame banlist is done, confure your board however you want as long as you leave the "Ban List" list that contains name and keep the board public so the script can read it!
		Use our site for reference: https://trello.com/b/9HH6BEX2/epix-incorporated-synced-ban-list
		
		To use this for synced admin lists, simply repeat the above steps replacing Ban List with
		Admin List, TempAdmin List, or Owner List, anyone added to these list will appear in
		the admin list with [Synced] next to their name, they will not be able to be unadmined.
		Admin lists do not yet support Group: NAME:ID however they do support Username:ID format.

		For AutoUpdate to work this script's model needs to be in your inventory,
		if you got the script from anywhere other than my models the AutoUpdate
		will not work due to ROBLOX security nonsense. You can find the model
		here: http://www.mulrbx.com/Kohls-Admin-Epix-Edit-item?id=145629584
		
		For information about LoadStringEnabled please refer to the following:
		
		http://wiki.mulrbx.com/index.php?title=Security#LoadStringEnabled
		http://wiki.mulrbx.com/index.php?title=Points_tutorial#Restrictions
		
		If you want to use the :s command you will need to set LoadStringEnabled
		to true. It can be found by going into studio, opening the explorer and properties
		windows, clicking on ServerScriptService and under properties checking
		LoadStringEnabled. Loadstring is only used in the script for Output and
		the scripting command. The script will function fine without it. Currently
		:ls and :cs are unusable due to updates that removed loadstring() abilities
		from the client, meaning no more local script building in-game.
		------------------------------------------------------------------------
		IF THERE ARE NEW SETTINGS YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY UPDATE THE SCRIPT TO
		CHANGE THEM, THEY WILL OTHERWISE BE LEFT AS THE DEFAULT. (Unless you use :settings)

		Credit: 
		
		-Kohltastrophe (Scripth) for the original script this was based on and for sharing
		some of his ideas and commands, and his continued help and support
		
		-Sceleratis for this version of Kohl's Admin
		
		-einsteinK for the original SBL older versions used and his help with some things, legit best scripter I know.
		
		-Arlikas for testing nearly anything I ask him to
		
		-GigsD4X and the F3X team for the F3X tool, full credit to them. I only made it into a hopperbin for this script.
		
		-Everyone who helped me with testing, and suggested new ideas, features, and commands.
		
		I in no way claim to have made Kohl's Admin Commands, I have only
		made this version of it.
		
		If you have any questions, need help, or want to contact me you can send 
		me a Private Message on the main website (mulrbx.com) via my profile ("Send Message"
		under my avatar/character picture.)
		
		If you want to support the real Kohltastrophe put the following on your profile:
		"Scripth is the real Kohltastrophe. Put this on your profile so people know."
		
		Say what you will about this script, the original was a turning point for all 
		admin scripts, you can say "ew" all you want but it won't change that. If you can
		make something better then please go right ahead. I have chosen to continue the development
		of Kohl's Admin mostly as a hobby. If you are going to complain about something that is not a bug
		then please, at least get your information in order before you do. Blind critism helps no one.
	
		There is nothing hidden, I have place owner powers in your game, however
		they are fully optional and only used for debugging the script. 
		I would never force you to use anything, so you can optionally remove these 
		abilities by setting the following setting to false:																			]]
		set.CreatorDebugPowers=false															--[[
		Its completely your choice. I will still try to help you whether you disable 
		this or not, just know that it may make things more difficult and time consuming. 
		If you know what you are doing then feel free to disable this as you probably 
		won't need it anyway. The common situations people need help for are
		misconfigured setting, place owner powers are needed so I can view errors and 
		info that is in the server log (:debuglogs) and usually view/fix settings (:settings)

	-- Tips and Tricks --
	---------------------
	--[[
		
			:kill me,noob1,noob2,!random,%raiders,$123456,!nonadmins
			-- kills you, noob1, noob2, a random person, team raiders, people in group 123456, and nonadmins.
			You can also run silent commands using /e, for example:
			"/e :kill kohl" Do not that this will still show up in logs.
			*Note, by silent I just mean people won't see you chat it, it however will still show up in logs.
			
		You can also use a variety commands for different people;
			 all -- Everyone in the server
			 others -- Everyone but you
			 me -- You
			 admins -- Admins in the server
			 nonadmins -- People who are not admins in the server
			 random -- A random person, this can include you.
			 %TEAMNAME -- Ex: :kill %raiders will kill everyone in team Raiders.
			 $GROUPID -- Let you kill anyone in a specific group, if an id is not given it will use the GroupId setting.
			 -PLAYERNAME -- Lets you exclude players from commands, :kill !all,-kohl will kill everyone but kohl
			
		If you want to add cameras to your game (like saved into your game so you don't need to use the admin script to spawn them every new server)
		then just make a camera, needs to be a single part, so a sphere, brick, what ever it may be, make sure its anchored and locked
		just simply position it where you want in workspace, then make its name Camera: NAMEHERE
		so for example: Camera: Cam1
		the name is very important as the script will look for it in workspace when the game starts.
		make sure you name each camera something diffierent. You can preset waypoints the same way, just use Waypoint: instead of Camera:
		
		MESSAGES/HINTS FOR OTHER SCRIPTS:
		If you would like to have the hints/messages from this script usable in other SERVER (not local)
		scripts, then simply put the follow at the top of your script,
		
		message=_G['Message']
		hint=_G['Hint']
		
		USAGE EXAMPLES: 
		hint(msg,playerstable) - message(title,msg,playerstable)
		
		(Do note that playerstable needs to be a table containing players NOT player names! 
		Use game:service('Players'):children() to send a message to everyone.)
		
		hint('Hello people',game:service('Players'):children())  <=== sends "Hello people" to all players in game
		hint('Heyo montano',{game:service('Players').Sceleratis}) <=== Sends "Heyo montano" to the player Sceleratis
		message('Server Message','Hello people',game:service('Players'):children())  <=== Makes a message with the title "Server Message" and a message of "Hello people"
		message('Message from swagyguy','Heyo celary man',{game:service('Players').Sceleratis}) <=== Works the same as above but only the player Sceleratis sees it

	Hi, this is an example plugin, meaning this is only to show you how to make your own plugins!
	All plugins need to be MODULE SCRIPTS! Not regular or local scripts, if its not a module script it wont work.
	If you want to use events from the main admin script such as CharacterAdded, PlayerChatted and
	PlayerJoined then simply look the following:
	
	set.MakePluginEvent('PlayerChatted',function(msg,plr) print(msg..' from '..plr.Name..' Example Plugin') end)
	set.MakePluginEvent('PlayerJoined',function(p) print(p.Name..' Joined! Example Plugin') end)
	set.MakePluginEvent('CharacterAdded',function(plr) set.RunCommand('name',plr.Name,'BobTest Example Plugin') end)
	
	Use set.MakePluginEvent(type,function) to add a function that gets run when the event is fired in the
	main script, only CharacterAdded, PlayerJoined and PlayerChatted are currently supported.
	
	If you want to run an admin command from a plugin, you need to use set.RunCommand(cmd,args)
	EX: set.RunCommand('name',plr.Name,'BobTest Example Plugin') will run ":name Player1 BobTests Example Plugin"
	NOTE: If you are running a command that needs a sending player (such as !quote, !donate, !explore, or any command that
	spawns guis on the player running the command) it WILL break, the script will continue functioning fine however
	the command will error and do nothing.
	
	Plugins give you the ability to change or add things to the main script without editing the
	actual script. You can add commands, functions, features, and you can use anything in the 
	table "set" (the main script table which contains all functions, settings, and commands.)
	
	First off lets go over the format of commands.
	
	Commands must be formatted in the following way:
	
	set.MakeCommand(CommandName,AdminLevel,Prefix,{command1,command2},{argument1,argument2},NumberOfArguments,function(plr,args)
		print('Hello World from inside an example command!')
	end)
	
	Now lets go over each element of MakeCommand function.
	CommandName - Name of the command
	AdminLevel - who can use the commands (-1=SBL owners,0=any,1=donators,2=tempadmins,3=admins,4=owners,5=trueowners)
	Prefix - the prefix to use (the : in :kill me) use set.Prefix to use the scripts set prefix (or set.AnyPrefix for the AnyPrefix setting)
	{command1,command2} - these are commands that can be chatted to run this command
	{argument1,argument2} - type of arguments (eg {"player","message"})
	NumberOfArguments - how many arguments are there? (How many times to split the message?)
	function(plr,args) - you need to include this, however you can change plr and args but its recommended you dont to avoid confusion.

	Now that we know what each thing is, go ahead and take a look at the example command.
	
	All the code to run MUST be in a function, as seen below, that gets returned. 
	Anything inside the main function will be ran by the main admin script. If you want to use
	things from the main admin script use set.
	For example: 
	
	function Main(set) 
		print('hi') 
	end 
	return Main
	
--]]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Begin example plugin

return function(set) --function that the main script will run
	--Lets make an example command
	set.MakeCommand('Example Plugin Command',0,set.Prefix,{'example','forshow'},{'message1','message2'},2,function(plr,args)
		print('Hello World from inside an example command!')
		print('The first argument is '..args[1]..' and the second is '..args[2])
		print('The player who ran the command is '..plr.Name..'!')
	end)--Player chats ":example Args1 Args2"
	print('Hello World from inside an example plugin!')
	--makes the command "example" and prints "Hello World from inside an example plugin!"
end -- end of the main function

--End of example plugin
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--[[
--Below are some real plugins that are functional.

--As another example I have included a plugin that will change the permissions of specific commands. You can see it below.

return function(set)
--make the table that holds our new perms and what command they are for
local coms={
	{cmd='insert',perms=5};
	{cmd='m',perms=5};
	{cmd='gear',perms=5};
} --Changes insert, m, and gear to place owners only.

--These are the commandss and the new permission level, refer to the top of Example Plugin for perm levels.
-- Do note the cmd HAS to be the command thats shown in :cmds command, so if you want tornado to
-- be usable by the game owner only you would put {cmd='tornado',perms=5}; but you CAN NOT user twister instead of tornado.
 
for i=1,#set.Commands do --grab commands, for i,v in pairs for some reason does not like to work for this
	coroutine.wrap(function() --wrap it to make the process go a little faster overall
	for k,v in pairs(coms) do --grab our table with the new command perms
		if v.cmd==set.Commands[i].Cmds[1] then -- if the cmd is the same as the first cmd of the target command then...
			set.Commands[i].AdminLevel=v.perms --set its admin level to our intended one.
		end
	end
	end)()
end
end

------------------------------------------------------------------------
below is a plugin I made for an automated barista bot that allows it to get chats from
the admin script and send them to the barista bot for processing, for server to server
communication like this its recommended to use bindable events, for more information here 
is the bindable event roblox wiki link: http://wiki.mulrbx.com/index.php?title=Bindableevent

return function(set)
local barista
for i,v in pairs(workspace:children()) do
	if v.Name=='Jessica' and v:IsA('Model') and v:FindFirstChild('BaristaStuff') then barista=v end
end --find the barista
local backup=barista:Clone() --make a backup of the barista
	set.MakePluginEvent('Chat',function(msg,plr) --Add a new function to run on chat for the plugin
		local sendchat=barista.BaristaStuff.Event --Declare the event
		sendchat:Fire(msg,plr) --send the chat to the barista
	end)
	--lets make the reset and on/off commands
	set.MakeCommand('Reset Barista',2,set.Prefix,{'resetbarista','fixbarista'},{},0,function(plr,args)
		barista:Destroy() --destroy old barista
		barista=backup:Clone() --clone the backup
		barista.Parent=workspace --put it in workspace
		barista:MakeJoints() --make some joints
	end)
	set.MakeCommand('Turn Barista On/Off',3,set.Prefix,{'barista'},{'on/off'},1,function(plr,args)
		if args[1]=='off' then
			barista:Destroy()
		elseif args[1]=='on' then
			barista=backup:Clone()
			barista.Parent=workspace
			barista:MakeJoints()
		end
	end)--does basically the same stuff as reset.
end

	Hello, my name is Sceleratis. The reason I had to add this nasty credit thing is because of
	people, like KohltastropheRBLX, who try to take credit for something they did not make and in the
	process spread false rumors thus bringing the legitimate model's reputation and my personal
	reputation down. So to combat people like this, I have included this credit value.
	
	Under no circumstances do you remove this, or you run the risk of breaking everything.
	
	I am sorry that I have to do this but it was assumed people know better and is ridiculous that
	I need to do this in the first place. Slowly losing faith in humanity.
	
	Aside from just ruining reputations, people who take the script from his models are, at times,
	a couple to even hundreds of versions behind, and the autoupdate cannot function without
	the model in my inventory in the place owner's models due to updates roblox made to the
	insert service a few years ago to try and stop some exploiting.
	
	Who knows, once he reuploads this version this "READ ME" might be removed, because thats just
	what he does.
	
	Scripth is the REAL Kohltastrophe.

# Explorer Panel

A GUI panel that displays the game hierarchy.


## Selection Bindables

- `Function GetSelection ( )`

	Returns an array of objects representing the objects currently
	selected in the panel.

- `Function SetSelection ( Objects selection )`

	Sets the objects that are selected in the panel. `selection` is an array
	of objects.

- `Event SelectionChanged ( )`

	Fired after the selection changes.


## Option Bindables

- `Function GetOption ( string optionName )`

	If `optionName` is given, returns the value of that option. Otherwise,
	returns a table of options and their current values.

- `Function SetOption ( string optionName, bool value )`

	Sets `optionName` to `value`.

	Options:

	- Modifiable

		Whether objects can be modified by the panel.

		Note that modifying objects depends on being able to select them. If
		Selectable is false, then Actions will not be available. Reparenting
		is still possible, but only for the dragged object.

	- Selectable

		Whether objects can be selected.

		If Modifiable is false, then left-clicking will perform a drag
		selection.

doc["Stylist"] = [==[
Stylist ( table `style` ) [constructor]
	returns: Stylist `object`, table `style`

Creates a new stylist, which manages the properties of an entire group of objects.

More stylists can also be added, refered to as "substylists".

When a property of a stylist is updated, the properties in the stylist's objects are updated to reflect it.
The properties of objects in each substylist are also updated, but only if that property isn't defined in the substylist's Style.

Arguments:
	`style`
		A table of property/value pairs.
		The stylist's "Style".
		Optional; defaults to an empty table.

Returns:
	`object`
		The Stylist object.

	`style`
		The style table.


Stylist Class:
	Contains the following members:

	Readonly:
		Style
			The `style` table.

	Methods:
		AddObject ( Instance `object`, table `alias_map` )
			Adds `object` to the stylist and updates its properties.
			If `alias_map` is specified, then for this object, properties in the style will first be mapped though this table (see Alias Maps).
			Returns `object`

		AddObjects ( table `objects`, table `alias_map` )
			Adds multiple objects to the stylist.
			`objects` is a list of objects to be added to the stylist.
			If `alias_map` is specified, it will be applied to all objects in the list.
			Returns `objects`

		RemoveObject ( Instance `object` )
			Removes `object` from the stylist.
			Returns `object`

		RemoveObjects ( table `objects` )
			Removes multiple objects from the stylist.
			`objects` is a list of objects to be removed from the stylist.
			Returns `objects`

		GetObjects ( )
			Returns a list of objects added to this stylist.
			Items in the list have no defined order.

		ObjectIn ( Instance `object` )
			If `object` is in the stylist, returns true.
			If `object` has an alias in the stylist, returns the alias.
			Otherwise, returns false.

		SetProperty ( string `property`, * `value` )
			Sets `property` in each object to `value`.
			Also sets the value in the `style` table.

		SetProperties ( table `properties` )
			Similar to SetProperty, but sets multiple properties at once.
			`properties` is a table of property/value pairs.
			To set a property to nil, use ]==]..PROJECT_NAME..[==[.NULL as the value.

		ClearProperties ( )
			Clears all set properties in the style table.

		Update ( )
			Updates each object's properties to reflect values in the `style` table.

		SetInternal ( string `property`, * `value` )
			Sets the properties of the stylist's objects and substylists without modifying the stylist's Style.

		Destroy ( )
			Releases the resources used by this object.
			Run this if you're no longer using this object.

		AddStylist ( Stylist `stylist`, table `alias_map` )
			Adds `stylist` to this stylist and updates its properties.
			If `alias_map` is specified, then for this stylist, properties in the style will first be mapped though this table (see Alias Maps).
			Adding two stylists to each other is not recommended.

		RemoveStylist ( Stylist `stylist` )
			Removes `stylist` for this stylist.

		GetStylists ( )
			Returns a list of stylists added to this stylist.
			Items in the list have no defined order.

		StylistIn ( Stylist `stylist` )
			If `stylist` is in the stylist, returns true.
			If `stylist` has an alias in the stylist, returns the alias.
			Otherwise, returns false.


Alias Maps:
	These let you set the property of an object as if it were another.
	For example, if an alias map contains ["TextColor3"] = "BackgroundColor3", then
	the object will have its BackgroundColor3 property set using the TextColor3 value in the Style.
	This implies that both properties have the same type, or at least be convertible.

			Passing one value specifies that all sides have that value.
			Passing no values sets all sides to 0.
			
			If the text is aligned to a certain side, the padding on that side will be ignored.

		Update ( )
			Updates the label.

		Destroy ( )
			Releases the resources used by this object.
			Run this if you're no longer using this object.

		SnapToContainerEdge
			A bool indicating whether dockables can snap to the edge of the container.
			Only applies if ConstrainToContainer is false.
			Initially, this value is true.

		PositionScaled
			A bool indicating whether the position of dockables are set as a Scale or an Offset.
			Initially, this value is true.

		DragZIndex
			A number indicating the amount to increase the ZIndex of a dockable by when it is dragged.
			Initially, this value is 1.

	Methods:
		InvokeDrag ( GuiObject `dragged`, Vector2 `mouse_offset` )
			Starts dragging `dragged` as if it were clicked.
			`mouse_offset` is the position of the mouse when it "clicked" the object, in relation to the object.

		StopDrag ( )
			Stops the dragging of an object, if there is an object being dragged.

	Callbacks:
		DragBeginCallback ( GuiObject `dragged`, Vector2 `mouse_offset` )
			Called before an object starts being dragged.
			`dragged` is the object being dragged.
			`mouse_offset` is the position of the mouse, in relation to the object.
			If the function returns false, then the drag will be canceled.

		DragCallback ( GuiObject `dragged`, Vector2 `mouse_offset` )
			Called when an object is dragged, before the object updates.
			`dragged` is the object being dragged.
			`mouse_offset` is the location of the mouse when it started dragging, in relation to the object.
			If the function returns false, then the object's position will not be updated.

		DockCallback ( GuiObject `dragged`, GuiObject `docked`, DockedSide `docked_side` )
			Called before the currently dragged object snaps to another dockable.
			`dragged` is the current object being dragged.
			`docked` is the dockable that `dragged` snapped to.
			`docked_side` is the side of `dragged` that was docked on.
			Note that `docked` can be the container, if objects are allowed to snap to it.
			If the function returns false, then the snap to the dockable will be canceled.

	Events:
		DragBegin ( GuiObject `dragged`, Vector2 `mouse_offset` )
			Fired after an object start being dragged.
			`dragged` is the object being dragged.
			`mouse_offset` is the position of the mouse, in relation to the object.

		DragStopped ( GuiObject `dragged`, Vector2 `mouse_pos` )
			Called after an object stops being dragged.
			`dragged` is the object that was dragged.
			`mouse_offset` is the position of the mouse when it started dragging, in relation to the object.

		ObjectDocked ( GuiObject `dragged`, GuiObject `docked`, DockedSide `docked_side` )
			Fired after the currently dragged objects snaps to another dockable.
			`dragged` is the current object being dragged.
			`docked` is the dockable that `dragged` snapped to.
			`docked_side` is the side of `dragged` that was docked on.
			Note that `docked` can be the container, if objects are allowed to snap to it.

doc["Graphic"] = [==[
Graphic ( string `polygon`, Vector2 `size`, table `style`, table `config` ) [constructor]
	returns Graphic `object`, Frame `graphic`

Creates a basic GUI graphic from a polygon or specified preset.

Arguments:
	`polygon`
		May be a string, referencing a preset (see Presets).
		May also be a table that contains two tables, which represent the x and y coordinates (respectively) of each point in the polygon.
		If coordinates are not between 0 and 1, a 3rd entry may be specified, which is the number to divide each coordinate by.

	`size`
		The size, in pixels, of the graphic.
		May also be a table that contains the x and y size of the graphic.

	`style`
		A table that will be used with the graphic's Stylist, which controls the appearance of the graphic.
		Optional; defaults to an empty table.
		Note that the graphic essentially shares the same properties as a Frame object.
		So, if ["BackgroundColor3"] = Color3.new(1,1,1) were in the table, the graphic's color would be set to white.

	`config`
		A table that alters how the graphic will be drawn.
		It can contain the following possible values:
			method
				May be "scaled" or "static".
				Determines if pixels will be scaled to the parent or static.
			round
				May be "half", "ceil", or "floor".
				If static method is chosen, this determines how to round each pixel.
			offset
				A Vector2. This offsets the polygon on the final image.

Returns:
	`object`
		The Graphic object.

	`graphic`
		The Frame object which makes up the graphic.

Graphic Class:
	This class contains the following members:

	Readonly:
		GUI
			The Frame object which makes up the graphic.

		Style
			The Stylist object used to change the appearance of the graphic.
		
	Methods:
		Destroy ( )
			Releases the resources used by this object.
			Run this if you're no longer using this object.

	`scroll_bar`
		The scroll bar GUI.


ScrollBar Class:
	This class contains the following members:

	Readonly:
		GUI
			The scroll bar itself.

	Fields:
		ScrollIndex
			A number indicating the current position of the scroll bar.

		TotalSpace
			A number indicating the total span of the scrollable space.

		VisibleSpace
			A number indicating the visible span of the scrollable space.

		PageIncrement
			The amount to increase or decrease the ScrollIndex when ScrollDown or ScrollUp is called.

	Methods:
		Update ( )
			Updates the scroll bar to reflect any changes.

		CanScrollDown ( )
			Returns whether the scroll bar can scroll down (or right if `horizontal` is true).

		CanScrollRight ( )
			Alias of CanScrollDown.

		CanScrollUp ( )
			Returns whether the scroll bar can scroll up (or left if `horizontal` is true).

		CanScrollLeft ( )
			Alias of CanScrollUp.

		ScrollDown ( )
			Scrolls down (or right) by the current PageIncrement.

		ScrollRight( )
			Alias of ScrollDown.

		ScrollUp ( )
			Scrolls up (or left) by the current PageIncrement.

		ScrollLeft ( )
			Alias of ScrollUp.

		ScrollTo ( number `index` )
			Scrolls to a specific place, specified by `index`.
			This may be any number; it will be clamped between 0 and TotalSpace.

		GetScrollPercent ( )
			Returns the scroll index as a percentage between 0 and 1.
			
		SetScrollPercent ( number `percent` )
			Sets the ScrollIndex as a percentage between 0 and 1.

		Destroy ( )
			Releases the resources used by this object.
			Run this if you're no longer using this object.

	Callbacks:
		UpdateCallback ( table `object` )
			When Update is called, the function is called before updating.
			If the function returns false, the update will be canceled.

StackingFrame ( GuiObject `frame`, bool `horizontal`, bool `alignment` ) [constructor]
	returns: StackingFrame `object`, Frame `stacking_frame`

Creates a frame that automatically resizes based on the objects it contains.
These objects are automatically positioned to stack next to each other.
Objects that have their Visible property set to false become ignored.

Arguments:
	`frame`
		If specified, then it will be used as the StackingFrame.
		Children that exist in this object beforehand will be added to the StackingFrame automatically. 
		Use the AddObject function to add children afterwards.
		Optional; defaults to a new Frame.

	`horizontal`
		If true, objects will be positioned horizontally instead of vertically.
		Optional; defaults to false

	`alignment`
		If true, objects will be aligned to the right if vertical (else left), or the bottom if horizontal (else top).
		Optional; defaults to false

Returns:
	`object`
		The StackingFrame object.

	`stacking_frame`
		The stacking frame GUI.


StackingFrame Class:
	Contains the following members:

	Readonly:
		GUI
			The stacking frame GUI.

		List
			The table containing the objects in the stacking frame.
			Should only be used for ordering items! Use AddObject and RemoveObject accordingly!

	Methods:
		AddObject ( GuiObject `object`, number `index` )
			Adds `object` to the list.
			If `index` is specified, the object is added at that position in the list.
			Otherwise, it is added to the end.

		RemoveObject ( number `index` )
			Removes the object at `index` in the list.
			`index` can be an object in the list.
			`index` can be nil, in which case the last item in the list is used.
			`index` is clamped within the range of the list.

		MoveObject ( number `index`, number `to` )
			Moves the object at `index` to the new index `to`.
			`index` and `to` can be objects in the list.
			`index` and `to` can be nil, in which case the last item in the list is used.
			`index` and `to` are clamped within the range of the list.

		GetIndex ( Instance `object` )
			Returns the index of `object` in the stacking frame, if it exists there.

		SetPadding ( number `padding`, number `border` )
			Sets the amount of space between and around children, in pixels.
			`padding` is the amount of space between each child.
			`border` is the amount of space around all children.
			
		Update ( )
			Updates the object.

		Destroy ( )
			Releases the resources used by this object.
			Run this if you're no longer using this object.

doc["DetailedList"] = [==[
DetailedList ( table `row_data_list`, table `column_scheme`, number `row_height` ) [constructor]
	returns: DetailedList `object`, Frame `list_frame`

Creates a customizable list for displaying data.

Arguments:
	`row_data_list`
		Holds all the data to be displayed.
		It contains tables that hold data for each row in the list (see Row Data).
		Optional; defaults to an empty table.

	`column_scheme`
		Contains information for how each column will be displayed (see Column Scheme).
		
	`row_height`
		Sets the height of each row, in pixels.
		Optional; defaults to ]==]..ENTRY_SIZE..[==[

Returns:
	`object`
		The DetailedList object.
		
	`list_frame`
		The DetailedList GUI.


DetailedList Class:
	This class contains the following members:
	
	Readonly:
		GUI
			The DetailedList GUI.

		Data
			The `row_data_list` table.

		Scroll
			A class for the list's scroll bar.

		Stylist
			A table that contains Stylist classes for controlling the appearance of the DetailedList.
			It contains the following values:
				Global: Every object in the DetailedList
				Cell: Every cell in list
				Header: Each cell the top (header) row of the list.
				RowSpan: Each cell container of each row.
				Rows: A table that contains Stylists for each row in the list, referenced by the row's data table.
				Columns: A table that contains Stylists for each column in the list.

	Methods:
		AddRow ( table `row_data`, number `index`, table `style` )
			Adds a new row to the list.
			`row_data` is the data to display in the row.
			If `index` is specified, then the row will be added to that place in the list, instead of the end.
			If `style` is specified, then the row's Stylist will be created with it.
			Returns the row's data table.

		RemoveRow ( number `index` )
			Removes a row from the list.
			`index` may be a numerical index in the list, or a row data table in the list.
			Returns the removed row's data table.

		UpdateRow ( number `index` )
			Updates the specified row to reflect the data in `row_data_list`
			`index` may be a numerical index in the list, or a row data table in the list.

		Update ( )
			Updates the display.

		Destroy ( )
			Releases the resources used by this object.
			Run this if you're no longer using this object.


Column Scheme:
	The column scheme is a list of tables, each representing a column that will appear in the DetailedList.
	Each of these tables contain the following entries:
		["type"] = (string)
			Indicates the data type of the column.
			More entries may be required depending on the type (see Column Scheme Types).
		["name"] = (string)
			The name of the column. This will appear in the header at the top.
		["width"] = (UDim)
			The width of the column.
		["style"] = (table)
			Optional. Defines a custom style for the column.
			If defined, then it will become the corresponding stylist in `object`.Stylist.Columns.


Row Data:
	A row data table holds the data for each cell of a row.
	Each entry corresponds to each cell in the row.
	Their types should match up with the column scheme (see Column Scheme Types).

	Example (for scheme {"check-box", "image", "text"}):
		row_data_list = {
			{true, "flower.png", "Flowers"};
			{false, "beehive.png", "Bees"};
		}


Column Scheme Types:
	Here are the possible data types, and their extra entries:
		text
			Row Data: string
				The text to display in the cell.
			Entries: none
		image
			Row Data: string
				The Content string of the image to display in the cell.
			Entries: none
		text-button
			Row Data: string
				The text to display in the cell.
			Entries:
				["callback"] = function (table `row_data`, table `object`)
					Called when the button is clicked.
					`row_data` is the button's row data.
					`object` is the DetailedList object.
		image-button
			Row Data: string
				The Content string of the image to display in the cell.
			Entries:
				["callback"] = function (table `row_data`, table `object`)
					Called when the button is clicked.
					`row_data` is the button's row data.
					`object` is the DetailedList object.
		text-field
			Row Data: string
				The value displayed in the text field.
			Entries:
				["callback"] = function (string `text`, table `row_data`, table `object`, bool `entered`)
					Called when the field loses focus.
					`text` is the field's current text.
					`row_data` is the field's row data.
					`object` is the DetailedList object.
					`entered` is whether the user pressed enter to lose focus.
					This function should return a string (usually same as `text`).
					If nil or false is returned, then the field will be reverted to the text before the change.
		check-box
			Row Data: bool
				The state of the check box.
			Entries:
				["checked"] = string, table
					The image (Content string) to display when the box is checked.
					If a table, its entries are the arguments to make a new Graphic.
				["unchecked"] = string, table
					The image (Content string) to display when the box is unchecked.
					If a table, its entries are the arguments to make a new Graphic.
				["callback"] = function (table `row_data`, table `object`)
					Called when the check box is clicked.
					`row_data` is the button's row data.
					`object` is the DetailedList object.
					This function should return a bool, indicating if the check box should toggle its state.
		drop-list (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
			Row Data: string
				The value displayed in the drop list.
			Entries:
				["items"] = table
					A list of items to appear in the drop list.

detailed list notes

	updating will take much more processing, due to amount of info per row
	there aren't going to be millions of rows
	so, go back to having frames for each row
	but, still use row indexing
	on update, stop displaying displayed rows, query new rows, display them

	row frames in the RowFramesList table are referenced by data rows in the RowDataList table

	PANIC: columns have a fixed width
	when updating, resize each cell width using one of the following options:
	->	basic: columns have fixed, perminent width, defined by column scheme, calculated once on row addition
		detailed view-like: columns have fixed width regardless of row content, recalculated when column tab is resized
		table-like: each column width is recalculated based on its content, when a row is added/removed (expensive)

	entry scheme:
		a table that describes an entry to the list
		keys are sequential, describing a part of the entry

		Entry Data:
			For a cell type, the acceptable entry data type is defined below.
			If the entry is a table instead, the first value in that table is the original data,
			while other keys defined will set the corresponding property of the cell.
			Example:
				As Data Type:	"A string"
				As Table:		{"A string", TextColor3 = Color3.new(1,0,0)}
		Types:
		Column Scheme Definition:											Entry Data:
		{"text"};															string
		{"image"};															string
		{"text-button", callback = function};								string
		{"image-button", callback = function};								string
		{"text-field", callback = function};								string
		{"check-box", checked = string, unchecked = string, callback};		bool
		{"drop-list", items = table};										string

		Each scheme has a 'name' key (string) and a 'width' key (UDim), which define he name and width of the column
		Each scheme can also have a 'style' key, who's value is a table that defines properties for each cell as columns

doc["TabContainer"] = [==[
TabContainer ( table `content_list`, number `selected_height`, number `tab_height` ) [constructor]
	returns: TabContainer `object`, Frame `tab_container`

Creates a container that can hold multiple GuiObjects in a single space by using tabs.
A GuiObject added to the container gets its own tab, which shows the GuiObject's Name, and displays the GuiObject when clicked.

Arguments:
	`content_list`
		A list of GuiObjects to be initially added to the container.
		Optional; defaults to an empty table

	`selected_height`
		The height of a selected tab.
		Optional; defaults to 24

	`tab_height`
		The height, in pixels, of a tab that is not selected.
		Optional; defaults to 20

Returns:
	`object`
		The TabContainer object.
	`tab_container`
		The container GUI.


TabContainer Class:
	This class contains the following members:

	Readonly:
		GUI
			The container GUI.

		TabStylist
			A Stylist object that controls the appearance of unselected tabs.
			Also controls the appearance of the content border.

		SelectedTabStylist
			A Stylist object that controls the appearance of the selected tab.

	Methods:
		AddTab ( GuiObject `content`, number `index` )
			Adds `content` to the container at `index`.
			if `index` is not specified, then it will be added to the end.

		RemoveTab ( number `index` )
			Removes the tab at `index`, and returns the content of that tab.
			`index` can also be a GUI in the container.

		MoveTab ( number `index`, number `to` )
			Moves the object at `index` to the index of `to`.
			`index` and `to` can also be GUIs in the container.

		SelectTab ( number `index` )
			Selects the tab at `index`.
			`index` can also be a GUI in the container.

		GetIndex ( GuiObject `content` )
			Returns the index of `content`.
			If `content` isn't in the container, this returns nil.

		GetSelectedIndex ( )
			Returns the index of the selected tab, and its GUI.

		Destroy ( )
			Releases the resources used by this object.
			Run this if you're no longer using this object.

Help ( string `query`, bool `no_print` ) [function]
	returns: string `message`

Returns help information for the library.

Arguments:
	`query`
		The name of the entry to display help for (case-insensitive).
		If unspecified, a list of entries will be displayed.

	`no_print`
		If set to true, the returned message will NOT also be printed.
		Note than when printed this way, the message is automatically formatted to maintain readability. 

Returns:
	`message`
		The resulting message.


Documentation Remarks:
	Argument and return values follow this format:
		type `reference`

	"type" is the argument's value type (string, bool, table, etc).
	Some arguments may accept more than one type. If so, these types will be indicated in the argument's description.
	An asterisk (*) as the type indicates that the argument may be of any type.
	Types can also be Roblox Instances, or objects defined by this library.
	The type "GuiText" refers to TextLabels, TextButtons, and TextBoxes.

	In the documentation, a word enclosed in grave accents (i.e. `example`) refers to the indicated value.

	Each entry has one of various types, which are indicated between square brackets (i.e. [type] ):
		[const]
			A constant, unchanging value.
		[enum]
			An enumerated type.
		[function]
			A function; receives arguments and returns values.
		[constructor]
			Similar to a function, buts returns an instantiated object.

	Documentation of a constructor will also contain a definition of the class it creates.
	Classes contain various member types:
		Readonly
			A value that is meant only to be read, not written to.
		Field
			A value that can be changed, affecting the state of the object.
		Method
			A function that does something internally when called.
			NOTE: Currently, methods must be called with ".", not ":". This may change in future versions.
		Callback
			Similar to a field in that it can be set, but the value is a function.
			When set, the function will be invoked at some point, and may have arguments passed to it.
			What the function returns can affect the object's behavior.
		Event
			Allows the user to connect functions (called "listeners").
			At some point, the event will fire, which then calls each listener connected to it.
			Values may be passed to each listener, received as "parameters".
